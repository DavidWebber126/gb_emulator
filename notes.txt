Notes:
- ld hl, sp + imm8 (0xf8) needs to check for overflow in setting flags. Maybe put into seperate instruction
since it is only LD op to change the flags.
- Need to finish LD sp imm8 opcode
- Implement sub_u8
- Put in prefixed opcodes
- EI is set at the next instruction after EI. I'm ignoring that for now and setting the flag immediately
- Better testing
