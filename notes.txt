Notes:
- EI is set at the next instruction after EI. I'm ignoring that for now and setting the flag immediately
- Need to implement correct memory mapping logic
- Need to display screen to see if tetris is working.
- Ppu tick needs to indicate whether to draw the scanline or trigger interrupt (or both)
    - maybe use a tuple
